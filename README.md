 Daves Referencing System -> Drs -> doctors: A simple php web-app for managing bibtex references

I wrote this web app in 2003 whilst doing my PhD to manage my references and bibliography. It enables you to heirarchically categorize your references, upload the documents themselves, attach keywords, search, and export a .bib file for inclusion in a .tex document.
